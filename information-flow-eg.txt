Program:
0: JumpIf0: R0+0=0 (â‡” R0=0): PC + 12w
branch 2:
4: LoadConstant: R1 = 1
8: Jump: 100w
branch 1
12: LoadConstant: R1 = 2
16: Jump: 100w


ISA level
0 -> 12 -> 16 -> 100 (if r0 is 0) tr1
0 -> 4 -> 8 -> 100 (if r0 is not 0) tr2
Using the same amount of time

Pipeline:
Same trace,
But if the conditional jump happened, tr1 will take 2 more cycles than tr2, so r0 is 0.
If we want the delay to be observed (for example via cache), we need the memory operation at locations 4 and 12, right?
