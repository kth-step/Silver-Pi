Silver-Pi: a pipelined Silver processor, implementation and verification in HOL4 down to the Verilog level.

### Folder
- `model`: pipelined Silver processor model in HOL4, based on the [verified Verilog model](https://github.com/CakeML/hardware/tree/v3).
- `proof`: correctness proof of the pipelined circuit with respect to the Silver ISA.
- `verilog_src`: Verilog source code for the processor and related hardware components (e.g., cache).
- `silver_isa`: Silver ISA specification in L3.
- `tests`: test programs generated by CakeML.
