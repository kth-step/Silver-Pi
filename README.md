# Silver-Pi
verified in-order pipelined processor circuit for the Silver ISA.

## Building

Requirements:

[Poly/ML](https://github.com/polyml/polyml): [5.8.1](https://github.com/polyml/polyml/releases/tag/v5.8.1) or later

[HOL4](https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL): [a development kananaskis-14 version](https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/tree/ff6e145992db7e75ae6798231ce09c3cc03538df) or later

[verified (System) Verilog](https://github.com/CakeML/hardware): [v3](https://github.com/CakeML/hardware/tree/v3)


Notice: the failed HOL4 files of the Verilog model (like `verilogWriteCheckerScript.sml`) does not affect building the Silver-Pi theories.

Please run `Holmake` to build our HOL4 files in the `silver_isa`, `model`, and `proof` folders.

If you want to test the processor on hardware, please use Xilinx Vivado v2020.2 to create a project with the Verilog files in the `verilog_src` folder and the FPGA board PYNQ-Z1.

## Contents
- `silver_isa`: Silver ISA specification in L3 and generated HOL4 files for the ISA.
- `model`: processor circuit model and related definitions, based on the [verified Verilog model](https://github.com/CakeML/hardware/tree/v3).
- `proof`: correctness proof of the pipelined circuit with respect to the Silver ISA.
- `verilog_src`: Verilog source code for the processor and related hardware components (e.g., a cache).
- `tests`: test software programs for Silver processors, generated by the verified [CakeML](https://github.com/CakeML/cakeml) compiler.
