# Silver-Pi
verified in-order pipelined circuit in the HOL4 interactive theorem prover.

### Folder
- `model`: circuit model and related definitions, based on the [verified Verilog model](https://github.com/CakeML/hardware/tree/v3).
- `proof`: correctness proof of the pipelined circuit with respect to the ISA.
- `verilog_src`: Verilog source code for the processor and related hardware components (e.g., cache).
- `silver_isa`: Silver ISA specification in L3 and generated HOL4 files for the ISA.
- `tests`: test programs generated by the [CakeML](https://github.com/CakeML/cakeml) compiler.

### Building
Requirements:

[HOL4](https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL)

[verified (System) Verilog](https://github.com/CakeML/hardware/tree/v3)

Notice: please use the v3 branch of the Verilog repository to build our work, and the failed HOL4 files of the Verilog model (like `verilogWriteCheckerScript.sml`) does not affect the pipelined Silver.

Please run `Holmake` to build our `silver_isa`, `model` and `proof` HOL4 files.

If you want to test the generated Verilog code, please use the files in the `verilog_src` folder with Xilinx Vivado v2020.2 and the PYNQ-Z1 board.
